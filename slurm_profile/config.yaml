# Snakemake Profile for SLURM Submission 

# 1. GENERAL SNAKEMAKE SETTINGS
jobs: 20                       # Max concurrent jobs - allows many samples to run assembly in parallel
use-conda: True
conda-frontend: mamba
latency-wait: 4               # Time (seconds) to wait between job status checks

# 2. SNAKEMAKE RESOURCE DEFAULTS
executor: slurm
default-resources:
  slurm_partition: "math-alderaan"
  runtime: "2880"             # 48 hours in minutes (max for math-alderaan is 7 days)
  mem_mb: 245760              # 240GB per job - assembly tools need this for large datasets
  threads: 16                 # 16 threads per job - good balance for assembly
  slurm_account: biology-miller-annotation
  slurm_logdir: /storage/biology/projects/miller-lowry/beitner/Lowry-assemblies/slurm_logs
  slurm_mail_type: "END,FAIL"  # Email on job completion or failure
